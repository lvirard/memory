///Memory

In the context of learning html, css & javascript as a student in application conception & developpement at Eni School in Quimper, we had to set this website from scratch in about 4 days. 
The minimal requierments were to : 
- set up a security system using the local storage to register & login with verifications.
- design the front of the website in a responsive manner
- develop an algorithm to handle a 1 user gameplay - a memory (with the image files already given) or another game of our choice

I started the project by getting a frame for all my pages with html & CSS. 
Then I focused on the system with JS to register some users in the local storage and to login. 
The third step was to develop an efficient game.
I finally manage to set up some criterias that the user can choose to play and increment them into my game. 

In a week, I did not had the time to finish everything. (It was my second week of javascript!)

TO DO : 
- !Mandatory / security : encrypt the password for it to be hidden in the local storage
- add a system to show the strongness of the password
- add a scoring system & display it.
- remove the option of clicking on an image already found.
